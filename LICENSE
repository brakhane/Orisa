While the code of Orisa is licensed under the terms of the AGPL (see LICENSE.AGPL), 
there are certain restrictions on running your own instance:

1. You must give any member of the server you run her on access to the source code 
   and your modifications (this follows from the AGPL)

2. You must make it obvious that your instance is not the official bot, by at least
   both of: 
  
    a) choosing a different name than just "Orisa" that makes it obvious it's not
       official (eg. "NotOrisa", "MyOrisa", "OverwatchBot", but not "OrisaV2"
       as that would imply it's a successor), AND
  
    b) adding a disclaimer to the "!ow register" answer text and "!ow about" info
       that your bot is not the official Orisa bot

3. If you allow your instance to be added to servers not under your control (by
   setting the bot to "public" in the Discord interface), you have to modify the
   welcome message it sends when joining ("Greetings! I'm excited to be hereâ€¦") to
   prominently display that your instance is not the official bot, and that includes
   a link to the official repository (https://github.com/brakhane/Orisa)
