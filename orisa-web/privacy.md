% Privacy Policy for the Orisa bot
%
% last updated 2019-12-18

**The following privacy policy applies to users that have registered
their account to Orisa via `!ow register`. Orisa generally does not store data
of unregistered users, except some data that might be written to log files
for debugging purposes, see the second paragraph for details.**

# What personal data does Orisa collect, and how is it used?

* **Your Discord ID and your BattleTags that you register with Orisa**

  Orisa's main purpose is to allow other members to ask for your BattleTag.

* **Information available on every registered BattleTag on Blizzard's playoverwatch site, like your SR (including the history)**

  Your SR is needed to show it next to your username and to determine your rank. Other information, like career and hero stats, or endorsement level, might be used in the future to detect inactive accounts or helping you and other members find teammates that play well together.
  The history of this data is needed to be able to show the SR history, and detect inactive accounts.
  When you set your profile to private, no new information will be stored; but the old data will still be stored.

Furthermore, the following personal data **may be written into a log file to help with debugging**, the data is not written into a database, and all log files are automatically deleted after 7 days:

* **Your Discord presence status**

  If you use the Discord desktop app, Discord might set your status to "Playing Overwatch" while you play OW. When your status changes to something else, Orisa knows that she should check if your stats change.
  To be clear, your presence status is *not* saved in the database, but might be written in a log file to help debugging.

* **Messages from you in bot channels that start with "!ow", as well as all messages sent to Orisa via DM (including those not beginning with "!ow")**

  These help with debugging problems. In case you sent something to Orisa by accident and want it removed, simply deleting the message in Discord is not enough; contact Orisa's owner Joghurt on the [Orisa Support Server](https://discord.gg/ZKzBEDF) so the message can be removed from the log file.
  Orisa does *not* log any other messages sent by you.

# Where is the data stored?

The data is stored on servers located within the EU.

# Who has access to the information?

Only other members of the Discord server you are a member of can access the information stated above (excluding information stored in log files), this includes your registered BattleTags, your SR, and the history of that SR from the time you registered. **Your information will not be made available to third parties.**

# How can I obtain a copy of my personal data?

At the moment, you'll need to contact Orisa's owner Joghurt on the [Orisa Support Server](https://discord.gg/ZKzBEDF); although "!ow dumpsr" pretty much shows all data Orisa has stored.

# How can I delete my data?

Sending the `!ow forgetme` command will delete all personal data from the database.

Some information might still exist in log files for up to 7 days. If you wish that data to be deleted sooner, contact Orisa's owner Joghurt on the [Orisa Support Server](https://discord.gg/ZKzBEDF).
